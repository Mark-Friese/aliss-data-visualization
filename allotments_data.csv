Lothlorien was originally started in 1974 by the Haughton family, who built the 13 bedroomed log house, one of the largest in its kind in Britain, from locally hewn larch and pine trees. It has been run since 1989 by the&nbsp;Rokpa Trust, an international charity founded by Dr. Akong Tulku Rinpoche of&nbsp;Samye Ling Tibetan Centre&nbsp;in Dumfriesshire. Buddhist values of compassion and tolerance are the basis of our approach, but we are not a religious community and are open to everyone.</p>",https://www.lothlorien.tc/,,01644440602,lucy@lothlorien.tc,https://en-gb.facebook.com/LothlorienTherapeuticCommunity/,,https://www.instagram.com/lothloriencommunity/,,"[{'name': 'Mental Health', 'slug': 'mental-health', 'selected': True}, {'name': 'Conditions', 'slug': 'conditions', 'selected': False}, {'name': 'Depression', 'slug': 'depression', 'selected': True}, {'name': 'Anxiety', 'slug': 'anxiety', 'selected': True}, {'name': 'Bipolar Disorder', 'slug': 'bipolar-disorder', 'selected': True}, {'name': 'Schizophrenia', 'slug': 'schizophrenia', 'selected': True}, {'name': 'Community Garden', 'slug': 'community-garden', 'selected': True}, {'name': 'Food and Nutrition', 'slug': 'food-and-nutrition', 'selected': False}, {'name': 'Health and Social Care Services', 'slug': 'health-and-social-care-services', 'selected': True}, {'name': 'Housing Support', 'slug': 'housing-support', 'selected': True}, {'name': 'Housing and Homelessness', 'slug': 'housing-and-homelessness', 'selected': False}]",[],[],[],[],"{'id': 'f09cb917-0dc1-4450-8f92-dad1cae57e7b', 'name': 'Lothlorien Therapeutic Community', 'aliss_url': 'https://www.aliss.org/organisations/lothlorien-community', 'permalink': 'https://www.aliss.org/organisations/f09cb917-0dc1-4450-8f92-dad1cae57e7b', 'is_claimed': True, 'slug': 'lothlorien-community'}",lothlorien-community,https://www.aliss.org/services/lothlorien-community,https://www.aliss.org/services/fb2c3910-e827-409c-b9f6-b2777dc33efe,True,False,2023-09-28T00:00:00,2023-09-28T00:00:00,1,f5b62a16-1ed4-49b4-9fea-5b95f73b605e,"Lothlorien Therapeutic Community, Corsock, Castle Douglas, DG7 3DR",Lothlorien Therapeutic Community,,Corsock,Castle Douglas,,,DG7 3DR,GB,55.074373,-3.951768

We grow vegetables and herbs in raised beds, have large trees in our small ‘woodland’ area, and maintain borders with beautiful flowers and bushes.

We meet on Mondays and Tuesdays 11am-1pm and Thursdays 10am-12:30pm.

We are a friendly group with space for everyone, regardless of skill level. We aim to provide opportunity for most physical abilities, and have lighter touch tasks such as weeding, sifting compost and sowing, as well as more physical jobs of digging and moving soil.

There are toilet facilities and limited car parking spots on the site. Unfortunately, our garden is not wheelchair accessible at the moment.","<p>Come join our friendly volunteers and trained gardeners at the People’s Garden at Peat Road Hall.
